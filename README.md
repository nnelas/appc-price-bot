# appc-price-bot

A Discord bot to check AppCoins price, in Python. 

This bot also haves a task that periodically checks the price change on the 
last 24 hours of APPC (%) and sends a message if percentage >= 20% or percentage <= -10%.

Uses Binance API to get 24h percentage change (and also the volume, although it's not 
currently being used). Uses Catappult API to get current price in both USD and EUR.

## Installation instructions (Linux)
